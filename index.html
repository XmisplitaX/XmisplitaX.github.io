  <p>if you have entered here, you may know what is territorial.io. However, if you are new and want to learn about it
    you
    should know several things.</p>

  <p><b> ¿what is territorial.io? </b></p>
  <p>Territorial.io is a videogame where the objetive is to gain the most territory posible managing your troops and
    making adventage between your opponesnts. It has multiplayer and 1 player mode to practice or just making rpg under
    your imagination</p>
  <p><b> ¿You want to improve on territorial.io? </b>
  <p> We all have been randoms, and everyone wanted to becomen an unbeateable player, but no matter how hard you try you
    never achive it. Well I'm going to show you a guide to improve in the game considerally, before starting i want to
    warn you not to frustrate if you don't achieve the waited results at the beggining, the experience also makes you

  <h2>SPAWNING</h2>
  </p>
  <p>The spawn you chose can decide your whole game, normally you spawn where there is more free territoy, that is the
    neutral territory where its only needed one troop to get one pixel of territory, like 0 density, but this is too
    advance, so just focus to land on a place where there is the most free territory posible, in team games this changes
    a little bit cause everyone will want to go to that spawn and the free territory you get probably will be reduced
    and also more ppl is aviable to attack you. Also try to spawn in a place where bots presece is high, botys are the
    players with underlined name thath recive less troups and are normally easier to attack. In the next picture i teach
    you where to spawn as an example.</p>

  <p>
  <h2>OPENING</h2>
  </p>
  <p>The opening phase is crucial for a good starting and indeed for having a good adventage on the whole game, there
    are severals openings that can be modified to be easier, this is going to depend on your experience or your
    platfrom, here you can visit the bests openings from the best players. For practicing them and trying to get the mos
    adventage of them, go to singleplayer and do the same things the guy in videos do, including cycles, Cycles are when
    the left side bar og the troops sing goes from bottom to top (10 seconds) and 10 ticks so the opening requiers doing
    the attacks. </p>

  <p>Now ill send the links of the most popular openigs you can follow. For more information go to territorial.io
    discord server. At the end ill put the link of the discord and for the game. </p>

  <p>
  <h2>INFINITE EXPANSION/END OPENING</h2>
  </p>
  <p>Once you ended opening its time to take the free land left, for this we normaly say to just atact acording you
    never end of attacking, however i made myself a trick to have a good infinite expansion. it consist on attacking
    with a 30% troops 2 or 3 times per cycle depending on the position. obviously you can make 50% or other strats that
    you feel more confortable.</p>
  <h2>MICRO PHASE</h2>
  <p>Micro phase is the most important part on 1v1, however on team games is not decisive at all, this phase consist on
    attacking the bots, if you wonder what bost are, they are the players with underlined name that recive less troops
    and indeed are easier to kill. Normaly to face this phase we attack bots with 8-11% depending of our troops and in
    team games do not attack more than 3 bots at the same time unless you know how to manage.</p>
  <h2>MIDDLE-END GAME</h2>
  <p>Middle-end game is the moment of the game after ending the micro till the end of the match, here you must focus on
    attacking the weakest people without becoming you on the weakest, we can achive this controling our density, that i
    will explain later what is it. So the objetive is to make good decisions, sometimes you have to allie with other
    players to defeat a bigger one, the most important thing is your benefit and the game-lobby benefit, if one team is
    dominating you should focus on that team, also you can get very big on a rivals backline, you can do many things but
    making good decisions is decisive thats what we call game sense, and the lack of it, SUCKS. You will acquier it with
    experience.</p>
  <h2>DENSITY/INTEREST</h2>
  <p>Density is the amount of troops you have per pixel. This is a complex concept and knowing about it is necesary to
    know how to use it. When you dont attack, your troops increase, well thats called saving up, when you save up you
    are increasing your density, which is good, this makes you more difficult to conqueer, in way that your rivals will
    need more troops to conqueer one of your pixels. Aplying this to the mid game, before attacking someone, look your
    sourondings because if someones with the same troops but with less density (more territory) will need less troops to
    be conqueered indeed you'll get more territory using the same amounts of troops. How do I know i have enough
    density? When the numbers of the green scuare of the image of above gets red.</p>
